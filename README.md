<h2> Project Preface </h2>

Eye testing app is a result of the thought of converting (or mapping) camera obtained annotations to real world distances, without using core mathematics and camera sensor matrix analysis, but using simple regression techniques, machine learning, and object detection models.

This app has three core parts which can be briefly described as follows:

1) Object detection: Obtaining accurately detected bounding boxes of concerned object, which is the human face with context of this app, using a pre-trained or newly trained deep learning model.

2) Machine learning: This part is the rendition of the thought as mentioned before. We prepare a model with machine learning techniques which has inputs: - annotations obtained, the device which was used for imaging, a standard size object annotations on that device and we attempt to get output as accurate “real distance of the object” from the camera as possible.

3) Ophthalmology: Now having those distances, we can use it for obtaining exact power of eye correction lens required for an individual, using the concept of optics for far and short sighted people and combining it with indispensable expert opinion of third party eye-specialists and ophthalmologists.

These can be integrated to one app.
